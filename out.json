Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions", "sections": [], "units": 6.0, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "name": "Pricing Strategy"}, "05-813": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": null, "building": null, "begin": null, "room": null, "end": null, "location": "Lisbon, Portugal"}], "instructors": ["Instructor TBA"], "name": "PP"}], "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "desc": "This course uses theory and research from human factors, cognitive science,  and social science to understand and design the interactions of humans with  the built world, tools, and technology.

They will be asked to engage in a recursive, reflective process to assess their own level of wellness in this area, develop short-term goals for the next year and a statement of a longer-term goal in this area, identify possible resources and then choose activities that promote this aspect of wellness.

inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each students individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models.  Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources.

The central subject of this course is process, not product. The programs that you will do are a means of teaching process, not an end product in themselves. The amount of process activity is clearly excessive for these simple problems. We suggest you read through all the programming problem specifications at the beginning so you will know where they are going early in the course. Then, when you feel that the process burden is too great, imagine doing a series of 300 line modules using the PSP, and see if you feel differently. We think that you will see the point very quickly and find yourself unconsciously applying parts of PSP to your own work before the course is done.  This course is intended for practicing software engineers and their managers. The measures introduced can serve as the basis for software development process improvement in the organization as well as helping individuals. Students who go on to take a more comprehensive course in the PSP will be able to concentrate more completely on advanced metrics and PSP is required if you intend to follow on with the concepts in the Team Software Process (TSP).  Requirement:  Since this is a development oriented class and involves writing code, all the normal tools one may use to develop code in their language of choice are required. You should NOT use this course as an opportunity to learn a new language as this course is intended to measure your already instantiated personal process.  Learning a new language will most likely cause you to change your personal process. Course requirements are not solely grounded in theory.

These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations.

The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.

Internationalization processes and globalization are general phenomena, increasingly booming in the last decades as rarely before. The arts sector (however defined) is not an exception: in terms of both demand and supply, no matter the specific arts discipline, there are clear tendencies towards the creation of a ?global? market. Here however ? more than in other contexts ? important local characteristics tend to ?resist? the process of homologation within a single global (undifferentiated) ?market?. Identity processes are often involved; different administrative trajectories also play a central role, in particular related to radical different roles played by the State and different government levels.  The course is organized around three main ideas. First, understanding the rhetorical nature of management (in general and in the particular case of art management) is an indispensable prerequisite to understand the social construction base of management discourse, and it possible variations. Second, there is the need to take seriously into account the implications emerging from organizational theory and strategic change literature in the context of the art sector, from bounded rationality to the dynamics of change. Third, there is a need to learn to deal with public sector changes in the variety of administrative context across different countries and different administrative traditions.

What does it mean to be Chinese in a diaspora context? Secondary readings, primary documents, and video material chosen for analysis will provide students with important insights into the diverse factors that have been shaping contemporary Chinese culture. This course is conducted in English with no requirement of prior knowledge of Chinese language for students who take it for 9 units. Students who take this course towards fulfillment of requirements for the Chinese major or minor must register for 12 units requiring completion of three (3) units of study in Chinese Studies.

Researchers in AI have studied planning problems for many years, and many techniques exist for automating planning processes.  This course will explore both classical and modern approaches to planning. Issues to be discussed include: how to represent actions and world state, how to search for plans efficiently, how to deal with uncertainty in actions and the world state, how to find good or optimal plans,how to represent time, and how to dynamically combine planning and execution.  Specific planning techniques to be covered include: means-ends analysis, linear and non-linear planning, partial-order planning, graph-based planning, heuristic planning, BBD-based planning, hierarchical planning, temporal planning, conditional and conformant planning, probabilistic planning and learning using Markov models (MDPs and POMDPs), integration of planning, perception and execution, execution monitoring and replanning, path planning, multi-agent planning, and scheduling.

Using an enhanced historical map of the city as a digital interface and an interactive learning tool, we will add a crucial visual component to the course and research the connections between urban and architectural space and the intellectual activity that took place in it. You will work in teams with students from other disciplines. You will research networks of intellectual and artistic activities and create 3D models of the spaces, from public squares to cafe interiors, in which these intellectual activities took place. You will create and expand a growing collection of records, photos, archival materials, as well as artwork, music and other media in an effort to reconstruct the dialogue among the arts and the cultural debate of this key moment in the passage to Modernism.

Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.

According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies.

A major premise of the course is that intellectual capital businesses must be managed differently than capital intensive companies. One important difference is that gold collar workers (people whose value to the marketplace is their brainpower) and intelligent technology are the key corporate resources and major competitive weapons. Success also depends upon the organizations ability to create and acquire knowledge that can be easily stored, accessed, and synthesized. If (as the media tells us) knowledge is power, then harnessing this power through sound knowledge management techniques is essential for a brainpowered business.    The class will involve reading and discussion of relative uncharted topics, as well as areas of practical concern to the manager.    These topics may include:    What is Intellectual Capital and is it important?    What new rules drive brainpowered businesses, and how do these differ from the rules for managing traditional industrial or service firms?    How to think about and develop strategies for brainpowered businesses.    How to identify, attract, and retain gold collar workers.

In addition to making photographs, students will determine the context in which their photo-stories will be seen. Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen on a website.  While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photo-graphic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith to the documentarians such as Walker Evans, Nicholas Nixon, and Alec Soth. We will look at photographers, too, who constructed private worlds, such as Duane Michals, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Charlesworth, and Laurie Simmons. As students explore both fiction and non-fiction through photographs, we will look at the interesting interplay between words and photographic images; how images are paced and scaled to create tempos; how photographs are sequenced to tell stories; and other formal elements involved in creating visual narratives.

Since 1960s the artists were trying to find a way out of this situation, and thus drew attention to the site and the context around a specific site.  Installation Art is a pervasive, varied and global practice for art making that acts as a gathering place for expression in all media, addressing all subjects in a wide range of styles by broad grouping of artists. It collapses traditional media boundaries and discipline boundaries.    In this class we will address some of the historical, conceptual, and theoretical aspects of contemporary art while studying a broad range of Site-Specific Art and Installation work. Questions we will explore include, if this category of art making is so broad, how is it different  from other forms of visual art? How can we define it at all? During the course students will explore the history of installation art as a genre  of art making that encourages invention and new ways of thinking about presentation and communication of ideas.  Site and Installation Art is based on the merger of Space and Time and on a relationship between the artist, space and the visitor. It continues to change over time, from early Dada exhibitions to community-involved constructions as found in Relational and Community Contextual practices. New Technology has become a vital tool for artists working in this genre.

Digital Goods Business: What is the nature of competition in digital goods market?  3.        IT and Firm Boundary: How does IT change Firm Boundary?  Our main objective is to understand the myriad linkages between IT and business strategy. We want to know how to align IT with business strategy?  How does IT transform business processes? What are the implications of IT outsourcing / crowd sourcing? Which IT investments are appropriate?  The bulk of class assignments are team-based. They include case analyses and a team presentation. The balance of the course grade will be determined by class participation and quizzes.

In this course, we will examine the sensory-level mechanisms involved in perception by various sensory modalities, including vision, audition, and touch. We will learn how sensory coding interacts with top-down processing based on context and prior knowledge and how perception changes with learning and development.

According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies.

As we analyze literature, visual arts, social debates, and current events, we will investigate how contacts with various forms of alterity have informed conceptions of identity and difference in 20th century France. The construction of Frenchness will be analyzed through the ways in which the society reacts to difference. To achieve these goals, the seminar will focus on five key moments in French history: the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889, the Interwar period, the Second World War and the Jewish Holocaust, the tourism boom of the 1990s, and the current debates on immigration and integration.

We will learn to identify tastemakers and trendsetters by looking at how information moves through our increasingly connected society. We will consider how our own position in the social network affects our behavior, opinions, and outcomes. And we will explore where social networks come from, and what affects their structure. The material in this course will be interdisciplinary, drawn from the fields of math, computer science, physics, sociology, political science, and economics. By the end of the course, you will have the tools and knowledge needed to analyze social networks on your own. The course is capped with a project where you will use your skills to answer your own questions. (Lecture, 3 hours).

This course proceeds simultaneously along two tracks. Track I will cover the law and procedures you need to understand how the federal budget is formulated and acted upon. This sounds dull, but it isnt For good reason, people call Congress the worlds greatest soap opera; and the budget process, while complex, is full of political warfare, the clashing of egos, and the constant pressure of voter demands. Those who know the law and procedures can gain an advantage over others in the struggle for dollars and the way they get spent.  Track II will introduce you in some of the important budget issues that have made life so difficult for Republicans and Democrats alike: working out an effective budget process, balancing the budget, funding budget priorities with limited resources, and deciding how much (and how) to tax workers and investors.  When we are working on Track II, you will develop two-pagers, the kinds of memoranda and statements written by congressional staff and political advisers.

Once the groundwork has been laid, the class will be divided into three-to-five-person writing teams. Then, taking an existing pen-and-paper RPG system proceed to create and pitch a set of campaign adventure stories for that system and that story intellectual property. The pitch will then be fine-tuned and approved, and the students proceed to flesh out their new story, delivering a full prose treatment, followed by Act breakdowns, mission arcs, dialogue for select scenes, and one shooting script for a two-minute cinematic.

We help to identify an opportunity for a robotics business and explore the business fundamentals of how to build and manage it.  The first step is to develop an appropriate innovative idea that can find a profitable home in the marketplace.  To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the prevalent trends of the current economic environment and how to market and position your product.  Here we utilize experts in marketing and innovation management.  The product may be a consumer product, or an improvement process  for some aspect of a business cycle (e.g., manufacturing or service).

Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising your own writing and the writing of others.  Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved good style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?", "sections": [], "units": 9.0, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "department": "English", "name": "Style"}, "70-462": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": "36-201 or 36-207 or 70-207 or 36-225 or 36-220", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "building": "CYH", "begin": "03:00PM", "room": "100D", "end": "04:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}, {"days": [5], "building": "PH", "begin": "03:00PM", "room": "125B", "end": "04:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Delasay Sorkhab, Mohammad"], "name": "A"}], "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["36-201", "36-207", "70-207", "36-225", "36-220"]], "invert": false}, "desc": "This hands-on course on computer simulation of business, service, and manufacturing systems (that are subject to uncertainty or risk) takes the perspective of the consultant whose job is to analyze stochastic decision problems by building a simulation model and using it to understand the behavior of the system and explore the effects of alternative decisions.

Its role is to overcome the limitations of the traditional camera by using computational techniques to produce a richer, more vivid, perhaps more perceptually meaningful representation of our visual world.  The aim of this advanced undergraduate course is to study ways in which samples from the real world (images and video) can be used to generate compelling computer graphics imagery. We will learn how to acquire, represent, and render scenes from digitized photographs. Several popular image-based algorithms will be presented, with an emphasis on using these techniques to build practical systems. This hands-on emphasis will be reflected in the programming assignments, in which students will have the opportunity to acquire their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and develop the image analysis and synthesis tools needed to render and view the scenes on the computer.

Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies.

The semester will be broken in to 3 parts:Intro/Exploration and a long term project. In Intro/Exploration, students will have many hands on opportunities to start to build a common language to describe spacial investigations as well as creating them.

They will focus on Making.  The second half of the semester will consist of one long term project to be created individually, incorporating students? personal theories of architecture based on an overarching question.  Studio work will be supported by group discussion based upon critical review of student work, readings, slide presentations, videos and films. There will also be a few field trips.

Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy.  Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process.

It will examine what companies must do to attract, keep, and get repeat business from highly satisfied customers.  It will explore how traditional businesses accomplish these goals and whether traditional concepts/tools apply to e-commerce companies.  When possible, it will highlight traditional and e-commerce companies that provide positive and negative examples.    The course will also distinguish between e-commerce companies that provide a service and those that are customer-driven arms for manufacturing companies.  Even some manufacturing companies (e.g. autos and computers) that traditionally were production or technology driven now find competitive advantage in being customer-driven.  (Ford Motor changed its company slogan from Quality if 1 at Ford to The Customer is 1 at Ford.)  As these companies move into an e-commerce environment, it may require a re-thinking of their business and approach to customers.    Topics that may be included are:      What does it mean to be customer-driven for any business?      How do you (or should you) make your firm more customer-driven?      How does a customer-driven strategy change the way a company positions itse", "sections": [], "units": 6.0, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "name": "Customer-Driven Strategies and Services"}, "80-816": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [1, 3], "building": "BH", "begin": "03:00PM", "room": "150", "end": "04:20PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Zhang, Kun"], "name": "A"}], "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "desc": "Causal connections are usually more informative and helpful than associational information, especially in understanding, control, decision-making, and prediction in changing environments.

This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive.

Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

The study of random walks on a graph was one of the first users of spectral graph theory. Answering such questions as: How many times should you shuffle a deck of cards to insure that the deck is well shuffled? More recent application include Googles page rank algorithm which performs a random walk on the hyperlink graph of the Internet. It has also been applied to the problem of finding these eigenvectors as well as solving related linear systems.....

As a result, present-day decision makers face an increasingly formidable task of internalizing huge amounts of time-critical information while being expected to always make the right decisions at the right times.  Conveniently, Data Science comes to their rescue.  Applied Data Science aims to achieve two main goals. The first is to optimize the efficiency of decision making by human managers. The second is to maximize the utilization of available data, so that no important clue is ever missed. This course aims at building expertize required to achieve those goals in practice. Students will have the opportunity to gain and solidify knowledge of the most important contemporary methods of Data Science, and to develop understanding of practical applicability of the studied topics in business scenarios.

Where applicable, comparisons are also made between solutions derived via the full theory of elasticity and simplified solutions developed in strength of materials courses. 4 hrs. lec.", "sections": [], "units": 12.0, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["24-701"]], "invert": false}, "department": "Civil & Environmental Engineering", "name": "Introduction to Solid Mechanics I"}, "48-804": {"coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [6], "building": "MM", "begin": "09:00AM", "room": "410", "end": "05:00PM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "instructors": ["Marion, Flore"], "name": "A"}], "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "desc": "Conduct workshops for collaborative research and information exchange meetings with EU cohorts visiting from the Universit Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, Doctoral Programs in Architecture.

The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.

This has two distinct aspects -- characterization and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.
