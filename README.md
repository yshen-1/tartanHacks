#Objective

Many incoming students at CMU experience great difficulty in using CMU SIO's built in schedule planner to register for their classes. The simplistic UI makes it nearly impossible for students to plan their college careers beyond the next semester, as the limited information SIO provides only informs students of course prerequisites, and not the courses a selected course is a prerequisite for.

The objective of this project is to provide a more user-friendly method for students to interact with CMU course information and provide a means for students to plan for their careers beyond the next semester.
