#CMU Course Galaxy

CMU Tartan Hacks 2017 project by Kevin Wang, Ben Soudry, Yuyi Shen and Jacob
Hoffman. This program visualizes STEM courses at CMU as an immense web, with
higher level courses branching out from the fundamentals. Selecting a course
with the arrow keys automatically displays lines connecting the selected course
to the upper level courses it serves as a prereq for. Pressing the 'n' key
displays black lines connecting the selected course to its prereqs. Pressing the
'd' key brings up a description of the selected course.
